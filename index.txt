About me

Engineering roadblocks? I turn them into stepping stones. I create highly scalable, resilient solutions that optimize both engineering performance and business impact.

With expertise in Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, and Swift, and a deep understanding of algorithms, system design, and cloud architecture, I create technology that empowers developers and captivates users.

I’m Wenxue (win-shur), but you can call me Wyllie. Code is my canvas, and innovation is my craft.  I believe technology should evolve beautifully without losing its human touch.
